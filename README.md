# Algorithms & Data Structures #

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/svillafe/algorithms-and-data-structures.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/svillafe/algorithms-and-data-structures) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/svillafe/algorithms-and-data-structures/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/svillafe/algorithms-and-data-structures?branch=master)

In this repository, you will find implementations of the most famous algorithms and data structures.
The majority of the code here is based in the pseudo-code that belongs to the CLRS Book. In code's comments, you will find the page of the book where the pseudo-code is located.

Below you will find the list of algorithms implemented from scratch:

### Sorting ###

* Bubble Sort
* Counting Sort
* Merge Sort
* Radix Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort

### Data Structures ###

* Stack
* Simple Node (Implementation of Node)
* Direct Address Hash Table
* Open Addressing Hash Table
* Universal Hashing Hash Table
* Binary Search Tree
* Binary Tree Node
* LCRS Tree (Left Child Right Sibling)
* LCRS Node (Left Child Right Sibling)
* Doubly Node
* Doubly Sorted Linked List
* Doubly Unsorted Linked List
* Adjacency Matrix Graph

### Dynamic Programming ###
* Fibonacci Numbers
