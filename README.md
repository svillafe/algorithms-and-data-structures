# Algorithms & Data Structures #

In this repository, you will find implementations of the most famous algorithms and data structures.
The majority of the code here is based in the pseudo-code that belongs to the CLRS Book. In code's comments, you will find the page of the book where the pseudo-code is located.

Below you will find the list of algorithms implemented from scratch:
